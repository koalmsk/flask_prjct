        "title": "Amateur Lasagna",
        "ingredients": "10 oz Frozen spinach|60 oz Spaghetti sauce; two 30 oz. jars|2 c Ricotta cheese; part skim milk|1 1/2 c Mozzarella cheese; part skim milk, shredded|1 Egg; beaten|8 oz Lasagna noodles|1/8 ts Black pepper|1/2 ts Oregano; optional|1/2 ts Basil; optional|1/2 c Vegetable juice cocktail|1/2 c Water",
        "servings": "10 servings",
        "instructions": "* Spaghetti sauce is available in a 30 ounce jar and also in smaller containers. For this recipe, I use about 1-1/2 to 2 jars of the Ragu Sauce in the 30 ounce container. 1. Thaw the spinach and squeeze dry. 2. In a large container mix the two cheeses, beaten egg, black pepper, oregano and basil. Add the thawed spinach and blend well. 3. Use a 13 x 9 inch pan. Put a small amount of the sauce in bottom and spread lightly to cover bottom. This keeps the lasagna from sticking as it cooks, and enables you to remove it easily in neat portions. 4. Place one third of the uncooked noodles, one third of the sauce and one third of the cheese-spinach mixture. Make 3 layers this way, ending with the sauce. 5. Combine the water and vegetable juice cocktail or tomato juice. Pour this carefully around the edges of the casserole, moving the noodles slightly with a spatula to get the liquid distributed evenly. Sprinkle with grated parmesan cheese if desired. 6. Cover tightly with foil. Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour to 1 and 1/4 hours. Remove foil and continue baking for a few minutes more, until lightly browned and bubbling. 7. Let stand for at least 15 minutes before serving. This lasagna can be sliced with a flat edged spatula and lifted out in serving-sized portions. NOTES : I call this Amateur Lasagna because it does not require the noodles be cooked beforehand and uses ready-made spaghetti sauce. The addition of the spinach makes it a very nutritious dish. This freezes very well in serving sized portions, wrapped in foil; to heat, place in oven while still covered, or unwrap and heat in microwave on 30-50% power."

        "instructions": "Split the jalapenos and clean as above. Chop the jalapenos into small pieces. No need to skin these. Put the NM chile, the jalapeno, and the crushed garlic together with 1/2 cup cider vinegar into a blender. Rev it up until it is liquified. Heat the sugar and 1/2 cup vinegar together and bring to a boil. Boil for about two minutes. Add the blended chile mix, and continue to boil for three or four minutes. Remove from heat. Stir the pectin together with 3/4 cup water in a separate pan. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil for one minute. Start this process before the sugar mixture is done, so you can put it in quickly. That is what your third hand is for. Add the pectin to the chile-sugar mixture. Add also the grapefruit juice. Stir it thoroughly, and allow it to cool enough for judicious tasting. Because of the way the chile pods were eviscerated, this syrup will have virtually no chile heat, but it will have a very pronounced chile flavor. It should be of a suitable consistency. If not, maybe you could boil it down or water it down until it is, although I do not know anything about boiling pectin after it is added."
